											<h1>Hi, I'm Jeremy</h1>

										<p>I’m 37, live in Canberra (born here, never left) and like all Canberrans, I work for the government. I'm about to commence learning tactile auslan sign language so I can communicate with my stepfather. I love AFL, can’t wait for the season to start. I have two cats – Fonz and Frankie.</p>

												<h3>What is your interest in IT?</h3>
												<p>IT has always fascinated me, the rapid rate it evolves means it will always remain interesting and relevant. IT has an impact on all walks of life, its application is limitless. There is so much to learn in a field that is a primary driver for change. 
<br>There is no real catalyst that sparked my interest in IT, it’s always been there ever since I can remember.</br>

<br>I’m an amateur enthusiast when it comes to IT. I am the go-to ‘IT guy’ for family and at work, I’ve enjoyed building databases and SharePoint applications – however, Microsoft products have been what my experience has been limited to so far.</br>

<br>I hope to gain a wider understanding of all things IT, with my ultimate aim being somewhere in the software development area.</br>
